    <h2 id="me">Me</h2>

<p>My name is Thomas and I’m a software engineer mainly interested in backend development or web-based full stack development. I have extensive experience working with Meteor.js as a full stack library, and also worked with makeshift full stacks by building REST APIs using Flask and Express.js and tying it in with frontend code using React or jQuery and HTML5. This tends to be my main focus on development as I like to design products to please end users, and by working on a full stack it is definitely easy to guide the development of a product from all stages of the development cycle :)</p>

<p>My main area of expertise is Node.js, for which I’ve been writing applications in 4 years, but I also have a soft spot for Python, Java, C and C++. I’m also a strong advocate for open source software, so I try to open source any of my modules for the public on <a href="https://github.com/itsjfx">my GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>For my education I have a Bachelor of Computer Science. I have various hobbies such as being into fitness and going to the gym (and I always love to chat about this!), I’m a big gamer too in my spare time but most days I instead find myself in VS Code writing up something for a personal project instead.</p>

<p>As for where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jfx</code> came from, well I thought it sounded and looked cool and <em>aestheticly pleasing</em> so I used it and it’s stuck ever since. This is the alias I mainly use online, hence the blog and website name.</p>

<h2 id="this-blog">This blog</h2>

<p>This is just a personal blog for anything I thought worth sharing on the internet! :)</p>

<p>The idea is for me to post guides for things here, but I don’t think this blog has a clear content field and it will just have whatever I feel like posting.</p>

<p>This blog itself is just a small blog made in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which is definitely very cool and fun to use. It’s also hosted on GitHub Pages which was very easy to get going (the Staticman integration made it very appealing!). A link to the blog’s GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/itsjfx/blog.jfx.ac">is here</a>.</p>
